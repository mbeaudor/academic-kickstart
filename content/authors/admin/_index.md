I am a PhD student at UVSQ working at LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement). My focus is on the global modeling of the nitrogen cycle and the quantification of the continental biosphere - atmosphere interactions. I am also studying the disturbances associated with the evolution of the agricultural sector and climate change.
